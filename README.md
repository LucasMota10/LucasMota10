### Lucas Mota - Student

 ● I'm currently following two academic paths simultaneously, studying Computer Science at the Federal University of Bahia and Computer Engineering at Senai Cimatec. My goal is to enter the job market in the area of computing and embedded electronics, with the aim of gaining professional experience and absorbing as much knowledge as possible.

 ● In addition to my academic commitments, I'm part of the technical team at CAS IEEE Cimatec and have the incredible opportunity to teach the Algorithms project alongside some excellent friends. This project's mission is to introduce freshmen computer science students to C programming logic, a fundamental step in their academic journeys.

 ● I also have a keen interest in competitive programming, which led me to represent Senai Cimatec in the OBI 2023 and SBC 2023 competitions. I look forward to continuing to learn and grow in this exciting area of technology, while collaborating with other enthusiasts and professionals to develop innovative solutions.
